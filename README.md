# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

The project's goal is to create table data that is stored in a JavaScript array. It also includes filters to render this table completely interactive, meaning it will react to user input, and it will then be saved as an HTML file for easy viewing.

## Results:

The dynamic webpage consists of a UFO Sightings button, which gives a refresh to the page, and some information about UFO sightings, finally, there is a filter search, which makes the search easier for users. Further, the filter search box gives you access to data, according to the date, city, state, country, and shape.

The dynamic table responds to the input information as the client enters information into the filter search. This dynamic webpage gives the impression of quick access to UFO sighting information. In addition, the filter search box will respond to information entered into it, and the HTML page will display the data appropriately.

## Summary:

One disadvantage of this website, in my opinion, is that there is no way to add new data to the existing data. It should also have a data entry option so that the webpage can be updated.

Below are a few suggestions for improving the website,

    - The website should be able to dynamically collect data in order to view the most latest UFO sightings.
    - The website might have a map, which shows the location of the cities or event place.
    - The data should have more data about the events, for example, it may include some photos or news links. 

Indeed, it should have a map, which is consisting geolocation for data entry and display.
